# Customer Churn & Retention Analysis Dashboard
This project analyzes customer churn patterns and key service-related churn drivers in a telecom dataset using Power BI.
The primary objective is to support data-driven retention strategies by identifying where churn is highest or lowest and what underlying service factors contribute to churn.

## The analysis is structured into:
A Churn Overview page to identify high-risk tenure and monthly charge segments
A Drill-Through page to investigate the root causes of churn by comparing churned and non-churned customers

## Tools & Technologies
Power BI Desktop
DAX (basic measures)
Data Cleaning & Transformation
Interactive Dashboards & Drill-Through Analysis

## Analysis Focus
Identify churn patterns by tenure and monthly charges
Detect high-churn and low-churn customer segments
Drill down into service-level usage to uncover churn drivers

Compare churned vs non-churned customers to explain churn behavior
